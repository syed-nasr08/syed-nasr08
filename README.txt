I'm a software developer with expertise creating AI-powered apps, scalable backend systems, and high-caliber Android apps. Microservices, cloud automation, data processing pipelines, and user-focused mobile experiences are all areas of my work. I like creating clear architectures that facilitate real-time decision making, enhancing system dependability, and resolving challenging technical issues. AI's potential to improve high-performance platforms and optimize operational operations really interests me.
